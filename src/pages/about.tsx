            Two places which share the same amount of sunlight in a day are
            joined together by what is called an{" "}

            Every 24 hours, this website collects data from OpenWeatherMapAPI
            across 17 different cities around the world. It will calculate the
            sunlight duration for each city and connect any that share an
            isohel.

          <p className="text-xl">Inspiration:</p>
          <p>
            I had the idea for this after listening to a song called
            &apos;isohel&apos; by EDEN.
          </p>
          <p>
            The idea really resonated with me and I thought it would be cool to
            build something in homage to this.
